//Introduction
/*Javascript tends to be used to make interactive webpages.
It's main motto is "Make it Move" and tries to bring "Life" to a webpage with interactions.
It is responsible for animations across the page and is a part of the following: Search boxes, Videos, Live blogs/scores/updates
It has nothing to do with the Java language - and although the names are similar - they do not work the same.
It's a very versatile language that can be used to create interactive web pages for both Desktop and Mobile apps.
It can be used to create iOS and Android Apps, or games.
It's also used to create fully fledged Desktop Apps.*/
