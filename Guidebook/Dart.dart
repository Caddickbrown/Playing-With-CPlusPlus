//Dart
//Intro
/*Dart is used for App development on FLutter
Flutter is a universal app framework for iOS, Android, and Web Apps*/

//Hello World
void main(){ //main() is a predefined method in Dart - and acts as an entry point to the application. void is the Return Type - and means we won't return anything. Dart needs these to run.
  print("Hello World!"); //Fairly straightforwards - this prints whatever is within the brackets
}
//This will output "Hello World!" You'll notice the syntax is similar to C, C++, and Java

//Comments
//These comments are exactly the same as C++
//Single Line - Use "//"
/*Multi-Line - Use "/*" to start. This is the start of a multi line comment
This is the end of the same multi line comment.*/

//Variables
var name = "Smith"; //Here the Variable "name" has "Smith" stored

//Data Types
//Dart Supports the following types of variable
  //Numbers - an integer or a "Double" (a fractional value - with decimal points)
  int age = 25;
  double piggybank = 15.60;
  //Strings -
  String cheese = "Brie";
  //Booleans - true/false
  bool isHappy = true;
  //Lists -
  //Maps -
